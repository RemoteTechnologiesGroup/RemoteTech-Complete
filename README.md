# RemoteTech
A community-developed continuation of the original RemoteTech mod for Kerbal Space Program.

RemoteTech allows you to construct vast relay networks of communication satellites and remotely-controlled unmanned vehicles.
Your unmanned vessels require an uplink to a command station to be controlled.
This adds a new layer of difficulty that compensates for the lack of live crew members.

# Installation
[Download Here](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Complete/releases/latest) on Github or on [SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/520/RemoteTech).
Releases deemed stable are numbered (e.g. `2.0.0`).
Development releases are prefixed with `build-develop`.

# Documentation
A [detailed manual](http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech) is available online.
