# Overview
This document is to guide you on how to clone multiple RemoteTech repositories on a build server (e.g. `AppVeyor`), compile source codes, package outputs, push the final package to an external platform such as GitHub.

# RemoteTech Next Generation repositories
Currently, the following list of RemoteTech repositories are
1. **[RemoteTech-Complete](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Complete)** is a centralised place where all RT components are pulled from their individual respositories and compiled.
2. **[RemoteTech-Delay](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Delay)** handles the signal delay calculations independently
3. **[RemoteTech-Antennas](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Antennas)** contains antenna parts for Kerbel Space Program. These parts are capable to function in stock CommNet without requiring RemoteTech to work.
4. **[RemoteTech-Common](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Common)** provides a suite of underlying common services and utilies to various major components of RemoteTech. 
5. **[RemoteTech-CommandHandler](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-CommandHandler)** is RemoteTech Flight Computer with different functionalities. It is able to operate independently from the other RemoteTech components.
6. **[RemoteTech-Transmitter](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech-Transmitter)** handles the entire antenna system of RemoteTech mod.

# Requirements
* Visual Studio 2015
* Python 3.5 or greater
* Shell scripting
* [Continuous integration service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
* Certain Kerbal Space Program files
* Git user authorisation for cloning, pulling and other operations

# Script and configuration files
The `scripts` folder contains all scripts and configuration files necessary to build a full RemoteTech release successfully.
* `build.bat` instructs Visual Studio compiler to locate and execute `RemoteTech-Complete.sln`
* `packager.py` is a package program to gather and package into a mod release
* `packager_config.py` is a configuration generator and storage for `packager.py`
* `RemoteTech-Complete.json` is a configuration file to be read by `packager.py` or generated by `packager_config.py`
* `update_subtrees.sh` is a Bourne shell script, that performs Git pull operations on all component repositories of RemoteTech prior to a build execution
